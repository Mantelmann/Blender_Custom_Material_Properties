# Blender: Custom Properties for Usage in Materials

This is a Blender Addon which allows the usage of Custom Properties of Objects in Materials.

# How does it work?

When having downloaded and installed the addon, go to the Object Properties of an object of your choice and look at the 'Custom Properties for Materials' tab. 

Enter the name of the Custom Property to be generated and click 'Setup Custom Property for this Object'. This will generate everything neccessary for the Custom Property to be used in the Attribute Node within the Material Node Editor. You will be able to access the Custom Property under the name _CPA\_propertyname_.

Similarly, you can enter the name of a Material, so that every object with that material will automatically get the Custom Property generated.

You can Remove the Custom Properties and their Artifacty with the respective Remove buttons.
